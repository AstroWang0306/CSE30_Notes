# Executing Machine Code:
1. Fetch
      1. read the instructions into memory
      2. prgram counter will automatically increment to contain the address of the next insturction (Instrcutions are 32 bits)
2. Decode
      1. Decode the instructions and setup the executions
3. Execute
      1. CPU completes the execution
      2. `Goto Fetch`

`MOV` Copying Values To Registers

```
mov r0, r1
```
register direct `addressing`

```
mov r0, 100
```
immediate `addressing`

`ADD/SUB` Registers

```
add r0, r1, r2
```
r0 = r1 + r2

```
sub r0, r1, r2
```
r0 = r1 - 2

```
rsub r0, r1, r2
```
r0 = r2 - r1

---
To perform a = b + c + d - e

r0 <- a

r1 <- b

r2 <- c

r3 <- d

r4 <- e

```
add r0, r1, r2
add r0, r0, r3
sub r0, r0, r4
```
